The Athletes' Relationship with Training Scale (ART) is a self report scale that measures an athletes unhealthy relationship to training and exercise using a likert scale from never to always

# # Scoresheet 
To clean the data, the likert scale was shifted so never=0 and always=4

# # Key Variables

'art_mean' is the total average score of all the questions

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(haven)
library(cgwtools)
library(readxl)
library(scorekeeper)

MAXED_raw <- load("C:/Users/Ella/Documents/MAXED_RA_raw.Rdata")

ART_scoresheet <- read_excel("C:/Users/Ella/Documents/art_excel.xlsx")

cleaned_data <- scorekeep(MAXED_RA_raw,art_excel)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
