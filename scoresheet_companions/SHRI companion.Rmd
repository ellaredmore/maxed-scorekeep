# # Background
The Self Report Habit Index is a 12 item scale that is used to measure habitual use of substances, or in this case, exercise. The scale is scored on a likert scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" Scores are derived by taking a mean score of all responses.

# #  Scoresheet

The scoresheet was cleaned by making strongly disagree score as a "0" instead of "1" and shifting all others down one number. 

# # Key Variables 

"srhi_mean" indicates the mean of all scores

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
